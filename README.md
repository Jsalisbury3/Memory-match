# Star Wars Memory-Match
> - This game is a star wars themed memory match game with 18 cards face down. The player is challenged to match all 9 pairs of matching cards
by remembering the position of the cards. Once the player matches 2 cards, audio will play that corresponds to the character that was matched.
Once all cards have been matched, or if the player fails to match all the cards before the lighsaber is run out, the infamous star wars crawl will appear with
a unique message. As the user clicks through the cards, the stats will be kept showing the user how many attempts have been made and the accuracy of their choices.
